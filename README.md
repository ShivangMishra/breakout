# breakout
This is a simple brick breaker (breakout-like) game in Java.

<h3>Key points </h3>

- Build tool - Maven
- GUI library - JavaFx
- Test framework - JUnit Jupiter


<h3>Key Features of the Project</h3>

- GUI (in CSS) with three themes
- Persistent High scores List, using Object serialization
- Support for procedural levels 
- Debug Panel 
- Simple powerups

<h4>Code Quality</h4>

- well documented
- adheres to Uncle Bob's clean code principles
- Design Patterns - MVC, Factory, Observer

<h4>Note</h4>

- The purpose of this project was to brush up on Design patterns and clean code principles, so I have not complicated the game features. Besides, I also used this project to experiment with Javafx as swing is practically obsolete, and javafx is the closest alternative.
- As this was my first project in javafx, some UI code might have traces of my swing background of over 5 years.<br>
I do not plan to fix it in this project, as Java isn't used much for GUI anyway.
